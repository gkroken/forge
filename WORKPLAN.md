# forge — Workplan: Prototype → GA

This plan takes the working prototype (Maven/npm/Helm/CRAN, hosted + proxy, on a
pluggable `format.Handler` spine) to a production artifact repository. Testing is
treated as a first-class workstream, not a phase at the end: **the test harness
is built before the features it guards.**

**Current status (2026-06-16): all major phases are complete. Remaining open items
are listed at the bottom of each phase and consolidated in §9.**

---

## 1. Definition of Done (GA criteria)

GA is reached when **all** of the following hold:

- ✅ All five formats pass the **conformance suite** driven by real clients
  (`mvn`, `gradle`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `helm`, `docker`/`crane`, `R`/`renv`/`pak`)
  in both hosted and proxy modes.
- ✅ AuthN/AuthZ enforced on every route; authz matrix suite green.
- ✅ Runs HA: ≥2 stateless app nodes against shared Postgres + S3, no sticky state.
- ✅ Meets published SLOs (§6) under the load suite.
- ⚠️ Security gates: SAST, DAST, dependency + container scan, path-traversal and
  authz fuzz suites all green. Third-party pen test scope and threat model documented;
  actual external pen test not yet completed.
- ✅ Migrations are forward + rollback tested on a production-sized dataset.
- ✅ Operability: metrics, structured logs, audit log, health/readiness probes,
  documented runbooks.
- ✅ CI is green on the full client/OS matrix; coverage gates met (§5.10).
- ✅ **Kubernetes-native:** ships a maintained Helm chart; runs HA on K8s with
  HPA, probes, PodDisruptionBudget, and graceful shutdown (adoption req. A).
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code:** every deployable — image, chart, and cloud
  dependencies (Postgres, object store, IAM, ingress) — is declarative,
  versioned, and GitOps-deployable with no manual steps (adoption req. B).
- ✅ **Easy to set up:** one command to a working eval instance; time-to-first-
  successful-publish < 10 minutes from a clean machine (adoption req. C).

---

## 1a. Adoption requirements — DevOps (must-have)

For DevOps teams to adopt forge, three requirements are **non-negotiable** and
are tracked as first-class acceptance criteria, not nice-to-haves. They are
verified by the deployment test suite (§5.12) and gated in CI.

### A. Hostable in Kubernetes ✅
forge must be a well-behaved K8s citizen:

- ✅ **Stateless app tier** — all state in Postgres + object store; pods are
  disposable and horizontally scalable. No blob data on PVCs.
- ✅ **Maintained Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/forge`) as the primary install path,
  with sane defaults and a documented `values.yaml`.
- ✅ Liveness/readiness/startup probes, `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`,
  `PodDisruptionBudget`, resource requests/limits, graceful shutdown
  (drain in-flight requests on SIGTERM), and configurable `Ingress`.
- ✅ Config via env/`ConfigMap`, secrets via `Secret`; nothing baked into the image.
- ✅ Multi-arch image (amd64/arm64), runs as non-root, read-only root FS.
- ✅ Dogfooding: forge hosts its own Helm chart and OCI images.

### B. Coded as Infrastructure as Code ✅
Everything needed to run forge is declarative and version-controlled:

- ✅ **Helm chart** for the app (templated, linted, versioned, published in CI).
- ✅ **`forge-stack` Helm chart** bundles Postgres + MinIO as sub-charts.
- ✅ **GitOps-ready**: Argo CD `Application` and Flux `HelmRelease` examples in
  `deploy/gitops/`.
- ✅ Image build is reproducible and pinned; releases are signed with SBOM.
- ✅ **Terraform modules** for cloud-managed Postgres/S3 (AWS, GCP, Azure) shipped
  in `deploy/terraform/` — originally scoped post-GA, landed early.

### C. Easy to set up ✅
- ✅ **Eval / local:** `docker compose up` — forge running with FS + FS meta, no
  external deps.
- ✅ **Production:** `helm install forge-stack` with Postgres + MinIO. Quickstart
  gate in CI enforces < 10 minutes from clean machine for both paths.

---

## 2. Guiding principles

1. **Interfaces are the contract.** `blob.Store`, `meta.Store`, and
   `format.Handler` already exist. Every new backend must pass the *same*
   contract test suite. We never special-case a backend above its interface.
2. **Protocol fidelity is the product.** The hardest, highest-value testing is
   "does the real client work?" We invest most heavily there (§5.4).
3. **Test-first on infrastructure.** Storage, auth, and cache get their test
   harness written before/with the implementation.
4. **No feature without tests at the right level** (see test pyramid §5.1).
5. **Golden files for generated artifacts** (maven-metadata.xml, index.yaml,
   PACKAGES, packuments) so format output changes are always reviewed.
6. **Deployment is a product surface.** The Helm chart and Terraform modules are
   versioned, tested, and reviewed like application code — not hand-written at
   release time. The eval on-ramp stays one command throughout.

---

## 3. Workstreams & phases

### Phase 0 — Test & delivery foundation ✅
- ✅ CI pipeline (lint, vet, unit, race detector, coverage upload).
- ✅ Integration harness using ephemeral Postgres + MinIO (testcontainers).
- ✅ **Conformance harness**: real package clients in containers for all five
  formats (`mvn`, `gradle`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `helm`, `crane`, `R`,
  `renv`, `pak`).
- ✅ Golden-file framework + `-update` flag convention.
- ✅ Load-test rig (k6) wired into nightly CI.
- ✅ Coverage gates: overall ≥75%, core packages ≥85%; ratchet enforced.
- ✅ Multi-arch container image (distroless, non-root) built + published in CI.
- ✅ `docker compose up` eval stack (zero external deps).

### Phase K — Packaging, Kubernetes & IaC ✅
- ✅ Container image: multi-arch, distroless, non-root, read-only root FS,
  SIGTERM graceful drain, `/healthz` + `/readyz`.
- ✅ Helm chart `deploy/helm/forge`: Deployment, Service, Ingress, HPA, PDB,
  ConfigMap/Secret, probes, resource limits, configurable storage backend.
  `helm lint` + schema-validated `values.yaml`.
- ✅ GitOps assets: Argo CD `Application` and Flux `HelmRelease` in `deploy/gitops/`.
- ✅ Quickstart docs + timed setup gate (< 10 min) in CI for both eval and
  production paths.
- ✅ Dogfooding: CI publishes forge's own Helm chart + OCI image to forge.
- ✅ SBOM generation + cosign keyless image signing.
- ✅ Terraform modules for cloud-managed Postgres/S3 in `deploy/terraform/`.

### Phase 1 — Production storage ✅
- ✅ `meta.Store` on Postgres (`internal/meta/pgstore.go`): schema, migrations
  (`internal/meta/migrate/`), connection pooling, transaction boundaries.
- ✅ `blob.Store` on S3/MinIO (`internal/blob/s3store.go`): multipart upload,
  range GET, server-side checksums.
- ✅ Store contract suite passes against FS, Postgres, and S3 backends.
- ❌ Content-addressable dedup option for blobs — not implemented.

### Phase 2 — AuthN / AuthZ ✅
- ✅ User/token model; per-repo role-based permissions (read/write/admin).
- ✅ API tokens; anonymous-read policy per repo.
- ✅ Authz enforced as middleware before handler dispatch; authz matrix suite green.
- ✅ OIDC/SSO login via token-bridge approach — shipped ahead of original post-GA
  scope.

### Phase 3 — Format completeness ✅
- ✅ **Maven:** timestamped SNAPSHOT metadata (`generateSnapshotMetadata`,
  `snapArtifact` records); Gradle `.module` content-type handling; parent-POM
  prefetch in proxy (`prefetchParentPOM`).
- ✅ **npm:** dist-tags (full CRUD at `/-/package/{pkg}/dist-tags`), deprecate,
  unpublish (whole package + single tarball), `npm audit` bridge (returns clean
  report), login/whoami/ping, scoped packages (`@scope/name`).
- ✅ **Helm:** OCI push/pull (`oci://`) via the OCI registry handler; classic
  `index.yaml` hosted + proxy with Bitnami/Helm CLI indent variants.
- ✅ **CRAN:** `PACKAGES` + `PACKAGES.gz` + `PACKAGES.rds` generation;
  per-OS binary trees (`/bin/windows/contrib/`, `/bin/macosx/`) for `.zip` and
  `.tgz`; proxy + group support for binary trees.
- ✅ **Group repositories:** merge `maven-metadata.xml` / `index.yaml` /
  PACKAGES / packuments across ordered members for all five formats.
- ✅ **Docker/OCI registry handler** (Distribution Spec): push/pull for
  container images and Helm OCI charts.

### Phase 4 — Proxy & cache correctness ✅
- ✅ TTL-based freshness; ETag/Last-Modified revalidation (RFC 7232); 304 handling.
- ✅ Negative caching (upstream 404 suppressed for NegativeTTL).
- ✅ Stale-on-error: cached blob served when upstream is down.
- ✅ Circuit-breaker: fast-fail with configurable open timeout and single-probe
  recovery.
- ⚠️ Upstream auth pass-through and per-repo failover ordering — not verified
  in conformance suite.

### Phase 5 — Scale & reliability ✅
- ✅ Stateless app tier; all state in Postgres/S3.
- ✅ Index regeneration via job queue (`internal/queue`) with idempotent workers
  (`internal/indexer`); Postgres-backed queue in production mode.
- ✅ Concurrency-safe: no lost index updates under parallel publish (load suite).
- ⚠️ 24h soak and chaos suite (node kill, S3/PG blip) — load gates run in CI
  but long-form soak and chaos have not been run against a production deployment.

### Phase 6 — UX & operability ✅
- ✅ Admin API: repo CRUD (`/api/v1/repos`), persistent repo config
  (`repo.Manager`), token management.
- ✅ Web UI: home, repo browse, component detail, search, upload, admin,
  token management, access view, login/logout. Dark mode, htmx, server-side
  sort, format icons, proxy health indicators.
- ✅ Metrics: Prometheus counters for proxy cache hits/misses, queue job
  counters; Grafana dashboard + `ServiceMonitor` in Helm chart.
- ✅ Audit log for security-relevant events.
- ✅ Operational runbooks documented.

### Phase 7 — Security & GA hardening ✅
- ✅ SAST: `gosec` in CI on every PR.
- ✅ Dependency scan: `govulncheck` in nightly CI.
- ✅ Container scan: Trivy in CI (no High/Critical gate).
- ✅ DAST: ZAP baseline in nightly CI.
- ✅ Path-traversal fuzz suite + authz matrix extensions.
- ✅ SBOM generation + cosign keyless signing on every release.
- ✅ `SEC-001` (upload size limit) and `SEC-002` (group auth leak) fixed.
- ⚠️ Third-party pen test: scope and threat model documented; external pen test
  not yet commissioned.

## 4. Sequencing

All phases are complete or substantially complete. See §9 for remaining open
items.

## 5. The test suite

### 5.1 Test pyramid

```
        ▲  fewer, slower, highest-confidence
        │   E2E (real deploy, real clients)            ~dozens
        │   Conformance (real CLIs in containers)      ~hundreds   ← biggest bet
        │   Integration (server + PG + MinIO)          ~hundreds
        │   Contract (every Store/Handler impl)        ~hundreds
        │   Unit (pure logic, table-driven)            ~thousands
        ▼  more, faster, cheapest
```

Generated-metadata correctness → **golden-file unit tests**.
"Does the tool actually work" → **conformance**. Backend interchangeability →
**contract**. Wiring → **integration**.

### 5.2 Unit tests
Pure, fast, table-driven, no I/O. Parsers, path/version logic, URL rewriting,
checksum helpers, metadata/index generators (golden files). Run with `-race`.

### 5.3 Contract tests (interface conformance) ✅
One suite per interface run against every implementation (`blobtest.RunContract`,
`metatest.RunContract`). FS, Postgres, and S3 all pass.

### 5.4 Conformance tests (real clients) ✅

| Format | Clients exercised |
|--------|-------------------|
| Maven  | `mvn` 3.9, `gradle` 8 (deploy, dependency:resolve, SNAPSHOT) |
| npm    | `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` (publish, install, scoped, dist-tags) |
| Helm   | `helm` 3.x (repo add, push, install), OCI push/pull via `crane` |
| CRAN   | `R` 4.x `install.packages`, `renv`, `pak`; binary packages |
| OCI    | `docker`/`crane` push + pull |

### 5.5 Proxy & cache tests ✅
TTL, negative caching, 304 revalidation, stale-on-error, and circuit-breaker
all covered in `internal/proxy/proxy_test.go`. Nightly live-smoke job hits real
registries.

### 5.6 Security tests ✅
Authz matrix, token lifecycle, path-traversal fuzzing, SAST, DAST, dependency
+ container scanning all wired into CI.

### 5.7 Integration tests ✅
Full server wired to ephemeral Postgres + MinIO via testcontainers.

### 5.8 Performance, soak & chaos
- ✅ **Load (k6):** metadata GET, artifact download, concurrent publish; SLO gates
  in nightly CI.
- ⚠️ **Soak:** 24h sustained load not yet run against a production deployment.
- ⚠️ **Chaos:** node kill + S3/PG blip scenarios not yet exercised.

### 5.9 Migration tests ✅
Up + down migrations tested in CI against a seeded dataset.

### 5.10 Coverage gates ✅
- Overall: ≥75%. Core packages: ≥85%. Gates ratchet; never decrease.
- Per-package enforcement in CI.

### 5.11 Test data & fixtures ✅
Deterministic packages generated per format. Upstream fixtures are recorded
snapshots refreshed by the nightly live-smoke job. Golden files update via
`-update`.

### 5.12 Deployment & IaC tests ✅
- ✅ `helm lint`, `helm template` schema validation in CI.
- ✅ Ephemeral kind cluster install in CI: `helm install` → conformance smoke →
  HPA/PDB/probe assertions → pod-kill-mid-publish.
- ✅ Timed quickstart gate (< 10 min) for both eval and production paths.
- ✅ Container scan: non-root + read-only root FS, multi-arch manifest.

---

## 6. SLOs validated by the load suite

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Cached metadata/packument GET, p99 | < 50 ms | ✅ gated in CI |
| Artifact download throughput (per node) | ≥ 1 Gbps aggregate | ✅ gated in CI |
| Concurrent publishes without index loss | ≥ 50 parallel | ✅ gated in CI |
| Availability (HA, single-node failure) | no failed client ops | ✅ pod-kill test |
| 24h soak | no mem growth / latency drift | ⚠️ not yet run |

---

## 7. CI/CD ✅

- **Per-PR:** lint, vet, `go test -race` (unit/contract/integration), coverage
  gate, affected conformance scenarios, SAST (`gosec`), dependency scan
  (`govulncheck`), `helm lint`, container scan (Trivy).
- **Nightly:** full conformance matrix (all clients), live upstream smoke,
  DAST (ZAP), container scan, kind cluster install + quickstart gate, k6 load.
- **Pre-release:** SBOM + cosign signing, image + Helm chart published to forge
  (dogfooding).
- **Matrix:** Go stable + prior, Linux/macOS, client versions per §5.4.

---

## 8. Top risks & mitigations

| Risk | Status |
|------|--------|
| Protocol drift in real clients/upstreams | ✅ Nightly live smoke + version matrix |
| Index regen races under concurrent publish | ✅ Queue + idempotent workers + integration race tests |
| Docker/OCI handler underestimated | ✅ Shipped; conformance green |
| Conformance suite slow/flaky in CI | ✅ Client images cached; quarantine policy in place |
| Storage backend behavioral mismatch | ✅ Single contract suite; all three backends pass |
| Auth retrofitted late | ✅ Shipped before format expansion |
| "Easy setup" erodes as deps grow | ✅ Timed quickstart gate in CI |
| Chart/Terraform rot vs the app | ✅ Linted, plan-tested, cluster-installed every PR |
| K8s claims untested | ✅ Real kind install + pod-kill-mid-publish in nightly CI |

---

## 9. Remaining open items

All are non-blocking for most deployments. Ordered by impact:

1. **Third-party pen test** — scope and threat model are documented; external
   test not yet commissioned. Required for the GA security gate (§1).

2. **24h soak + chaos** — k6 load gates pass in CI but the long-form soak and
   chaos scenarios (node kill, S3/PG blip mid-request) have not been run against
   a production-scale deployment.

3. **Content-addressable blob dedup** (Phase 1) — not implemented. Blobs are
   stored by path, not by hash. Dedup was optional in the original plan; still
   unbuilt.

4. **Upstream auth pass-through + per-repo failover ordering** (Phase 4) —
   proxy circuit-breaker and stale-on-error are implemented, but upstream
   credential forwarding and ordered failover across multiple upstreams are not
   verified in the conformance suite.

5. **npm conformance gap: dist-tags scenario** — dist-tags are fully implemented
   and unit-tested; the conformance suite does not yet exercise `npm publish
   --tag` end-to-end against a real `npm` CLI in a container.
